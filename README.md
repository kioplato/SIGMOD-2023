## Ideas
Baseline uses euclidean distance comparison only version. This version does
not include a square root over the result. More [here][2].

Approximate clustering exists. Can we implement it? Does it offer better
tradeoff over recall vs construction time?

Plot the recall score and runtime for various number of clusters.
